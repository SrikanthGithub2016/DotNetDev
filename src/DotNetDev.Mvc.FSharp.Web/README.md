# DotNetDev - ASP.NET MVC F#

## Notes for Express Users
Unfortunately F# does not come as part of the express editions of Visual Studio.  However you can still create and compile F# projects without cost:

Either:

* [Get the trial of Visual Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/try)

Or

* [Get the Visual Studio 2010 Shell](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=115)
* [And the most recent F# CTP](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11100)

The F# project can be opened and edited via the shell after installing these two packages.  This is a separate visual studio to the visual web developer express install.

You would need to install both, open the F# project in the shell and compile it.  Then build and run the web project from express afterwards. A slight pain maybe, but it works, and is free.
